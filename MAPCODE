## In excel make a csv of your latitude and longitude, with the headings Lat and Long, make sure to include minus signs where needed. You may also
## include a column saying what the proxy are - see example csv.


## Set your working directory to wherever you saved the file, you can do this by going to session, set working directory 
##and then navigating to the folder where your csv is saved

setwd("~/Documents") ## Another way is to set it using code. You can change this to the folder where your csv is saved.

## Read in csv file 

Sites<-read.csv("REPLACEWITHWHATEVERYOUCALLEDYOURCSV.csv") ## Make sure you put in here whatever your csv is called, capitals matter! leave .csv in at the end

#### Create plot to see where we have different proxies at the same location ####

#Uncomment the first time to install the package, recomment once installed. 
##Packages in R let us plot graphs or let us do certain statistical analyses

#install.packages("maps") 
#intall.packages("tidyverse")

require(maps) # here we are telling R to load the maps package
library(tidyverse) # here telling R to load the tidyverse package

world_map <- map_data("world") # here we are telling R to make a basemap of the world

## Plot the graph - this will take a short while
map<-ggplot(Sites, aes(x = Long, y = Lat)) + #Tell R the data set and the x and y. 
  theme_bw()+ # All of this sets the themes, colour and design of the map
  coord_fixed()+

  geom_polygon(data=world_map,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),fill="grey", colour = NA)+ # Creates basemap, you can change the fill to adjust colour
  geom_point(data = Sites, aes(x = Long, y = Lat,col=Proxy), size = 2) # Plots the dots of the proxy locations and tells R to colour by proxy
